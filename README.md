## Project Summary
Modelled after dashboard created for Austin Saxophon Ensemble to Track enrollment for 2023 summer camp

### Tools Used
    - Data cleaning with Google Sheets
    - Dashboard in Google Looker Studio
    - Dummy Data with Python Pandas, Numpy, Faker

## Problems to Solve
- How many students are enrolled?
- How many enrolled students have paid?
- Did the increase in tuition from $150 to $225 this year adversely affect enrollment?
- Do we have a good distribution across the different saxophones?
- How well have we retained students from last year?
- A majority of students have come from Leander and Round Rock ISDs in the past. Have we been effective in recruiting students from new schools and Districts?

### Insights
- Enrollment is currently up 38.8% and Revenue is up 98%
    - The increase in tuition helped boost revenue and did not adversely affect enrollment
- Currently 75% of students have paid
    - Need to send payment reminder to those that have not paid
- Of the 38 students from last year who didn't graduate, only 5 have enrolled this year
    - Send promotional email to students who enrolled last year but have not yet this year (listed on page 2 of dashboard)
- #####Start here with needing more middle school and sops and baritones
